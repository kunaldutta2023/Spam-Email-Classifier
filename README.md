The Spam Email Classifier is a machine learning web application built using Flask that predicts whether an email message is spam or not spam (ham). It uses a Naive Bayes classifier trained on a labeled dataset of email messages and leverages text vectorization (Bag of Words) for feature extraction.

The user simply enters a message in the input box, and the system instantly classifies it as spam or not, making it a lightweight and effective demo of text classification in real-world applications.
